# Fluent ffmpeg-API for node.js
This library abstracts the complex command-line usage of ffmpeg into a fluent, easy to use node.js module. In order to be able to use this module, make sure you have [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org) installed on your system (including all necessary encoding libraries like libmp3lame or libx264).

Now including input streaming support (means you can convert **on-the-fly** using an input- and an outputstream)!
## Installation
Via npm:
`$ npm install fluent-ffmpeg`

Or as a submodule:
`$ git submodule add git://github.com/schaermu/node-fluent-ffmpeg.git vendor/fluent-ffmpeg`
## Tests
To run unit tests, make sure have nodeunit installed on your system (currently, only npm-installed versions are supported).

`$ nodeunit test`

Make sure your ffmpeg installation is up-to-date to prevent strange assertion errors because of missing codecs/bugfixes.
## Usage
You find a lot of usage examples (including a real-time streaming example using [flowplayer](http://www.flowplayer.org) and [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express)!) in the `examples` folder.
### Auto-calculation of video dimensions
Since ffmpeg does not support dynamic sizing of your movies, fluent-ffmpeg can do this job for you (using it's internal metadata-discovery). The following size formats are allowed to be passed to `withSize`:

  * `320x?` - Fixed width, calculate height
  * `?x240` - Fixed height, calculate width
  * `50%` - percental resizing
  * `320x240` - fixed size (plain ffmpeg way)

### Auto-padding when converting aspect ratio
Using fluent-ffmpeg, you can auto-pad any video output when converting the aspect ratio. When converting from 4:3 to 16:9, padding is added to the left/right, when converting from 16:9 to 4:3, padding is added to top/bottom.

    var ffmpeg = require('fluent-ffmpeg');

    var proc = new ffmpeg('/path/to/your_movie.avi')
      .withAspect('4:3')
      .withSize('640x480')
      .applyPadding(true, 'white')
      .saveToFile('/path/to/your_target.avi', function(retcode, error){
        console.log('file has been converted succesfully');
      });
This command will auto-pad your 4:3 output video stream using a white background-color (default is black).

### Simple conversion using preset
This example loads up a predefined preset in the preset folder (currently, fluent-ffmpeg ships with presets for DIVX, Flashvideo and Podcast conversions)

    var ffmpeg = require('fluent-ffmpeg');

    var proc = new ffmpeg('/path/to/your_movie.avi')
      .usingPreset('podcast')
      .saveToFile('/path/to/your_target.m4v', function(retcode, error){
        console.log('file has been converted succesfully');
      });
### Conversion using chainable API
Using the chainable API, you are able to perform any operation using FFMPEG. the most common options are implemented using methods, for more advanced usages you can still use the `addOption(s)` method group.

    var ffmpeg = require('fluent-ffmpeg');
    
    var proc = new ffmpeg('/path/to/your_movie.avi')
      .withVideoBitrate(1024)
      .withVideoCodec('divx')
      .withAspectRatio('16:9')
      .withFps(24)
      .withAudioBitrate('128k')
      .withAudioCodec('libmp3lame')
      .withAudioChannels(2)
      .addOption('-vtag', 'DIVX')
      .toFormat('avi')
      .saveToFile('/path/to/your_target.avi', function(retcode, error){
        console.log('file has been converted succesfully');
      });
### Creating thumbnails from a video file
One pretty neat feature is the ability of fluent-ffmpeg to generate any amount of thumbnails from your movies. The screenshots are taken at automatically determined timemarks using the following formula: `(duration_in_sec * 0.9) / number_of_thumbnails`.

    var ffmpeg = require('fluent-ffmpeg');
    
    var proc = new ffmpeg('/path/to/your_movie.avi')
      .withSize('150x100')
      .takeScreenshots(5, '/path/to/thumbnail/folder', function(err) {
        console.log('screenshots were saved')
      });
### Reading video metadata
Using a seperate object, you are able to access various metadata of your video file.

    var ffmpegmeta = require('fluent-ffmpeg').Metadata;
    
    // make sure you set the correct path to your video file
    ffmpegmeta.get('/path/to/your_movie.avi', function(metadata) {
      console.log(require('util').inspect(metadata, false, null));
    });
### Creating a custom preset
To create a custom preset, you have to create a new file inside the `lib/presets` folder. The filename is used as the preset's name ([presetname].js). In order to make the preset work, you have to export a `load` function using the CommonJS module specifications:

    exports.load = function(ffmpeg) {
      // your custom preset code
    }

The `ffmpeg` parameter is a full fluent-ffmpeg object, you can use all the chaining-goodness from here on. For a good example for the possibilities using presets, check out `lib/presets/podcast.js`.


### Setting custom child process niceness
You can adjust the scheduling priority of the child process used by ffmpeg, using renice (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/intrepid/man1/renice.1.html), like so:

    var ffmpeg = require('fluent-ffmpeg');
    new ffmpeg('./source.mp3')
    .renice(10)
    .withAudioCodec('libvorbis')
    .toFormat('ogg')
    .saveToFile('./target.ogg', function(retcode, error){
        console.log('file has been converted succesfully');
    });

Which will use a niceness of 10 (thus it has a lower scheduling priority than the node process and other processes, which default to a niceness of 0).
